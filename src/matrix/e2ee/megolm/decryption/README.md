Lots of classes here. The complexity comes from needing to offload decryption to a webworker, mainly for IE11. We can't keep an idb transaction open while waiting for the response from the worker, so need to batch decryption of multiple events and do decryption in multiple steps:

 1. Read all used inbound sessions for the batch of events, requires a read txn. This happens in `Decryption`. Sessions are loaded into `SessionInfo` objects, which are also kept in a `SessionCache` to prevent having to read and unpickle them all the time.
 2. Actually decrypt. No txn can stay open during this step, as it can be offloaded to a worker and is thus async. This happens in `DecryptionPreparation`, which delegates to `SessionDecryption` per session.
 3. Read and write for the replay detection, requires a read/write txn. This happens in `DecryptionChanges`
 4. Return the decrypted entries, and errors if any
